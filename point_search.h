/* Given 10 million uniquely ranked points on a 2D plane, design a datastructure and an algorithm that can find the 20
most important points inside any given rectangle. The solution has to be reasonably fast even in the worst case, while
also not using an unreasonably large amount of memory.
Create an x64 Windows DLL, that can be loaded by the test application. The DLL and the functions will be loaded
dynamically. The DLL should export the following functions: "create", "search" and "destroy". The signatures and
descriptions of these functions are given below. You can use any language or compiler, as long as the resulting DLL
implements this interface. */
